## 🚀 Dream 2050 – Team Titan

*"Dream has no fear. Space is not out of reach."*

Dream 2050 is an ambitious **Virtual Reality (VR) simulation** created to celebrate the **25th Anniversary of the International Space Station (ISS)**.
Our vision extends to **2050**, promoting global participation in space exploration by bringing the authentic astronaut experience directly to everyone.

The project bridges the gap between **limited ISS access** and **seamless global access**, powered by:

* **Blender** (3D modeling)
* **Unity** (game engine, C# scripting)
* **NASA Open Data**
* **Gemini AI API** (intelligent assistance and contextual guidance)

## 🌌 Project Summary

Dream 2050 goes beyond passive viewing — it is an **active astronaut journey** that:

* Simulates **Cupola Earth photography** linked to real NASA data.
* Recreates **Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) training** with physics-based microgravity drift.
* Integrates the **AI Astro Bot Assistant**, which serves as a multilingual (Bangla & English) mission control guide.

Through these immersive experiences, users learn **problem-solving, teamwork, planetary care**, and the real significance of space exploration for life on Earth.

## 🛰️ Core Components

### 1. Cupola Photography Mode (Earth Observation)

* Sit inside the ISS Cupola.
* Capture images of Earth (storms, climate markers, coastlines, forests).
* Each photo dynamically links to **real NASA data**, teaching its role in disaster response, climate monitoring, and Earth studies.

### 2. Weightless Mission Mode (NBL Training)

* Physics-based **microgravity drift simulation**.
* Perform astronaut tasks: solar panel repair, plant growth experiments, and emergency response.
* Inspired by NASA’s **Neutral Buoyancy Lab training**.

### 3. AI Astro Bot Assistant

* Powered by **Gemini AI API**.
* Functions as a **personal mission control** in the user’s ear.
* Provides **data-backed guidance** and **Q&A support** on ISS, space science, and NASA initiatives.
* Supports **Bangla & English** for inclusive access.

## 🌍 Benefits of Our Solution

* **Authentic Immersion**: Users live the astronaut life, not just watch it.
* **Skill Development**: Learn teamwork, problem-solving, patience, and planetary care.
* **Data-Driven Learning**: Links actions (like photography) to **real-world scientific impact**.
* **Accessibility & Inclusion**: Future updates will add **cross-platform support** and classroom-friendly versions.

## 🎯 Our Goal

Our goal is to transform the **passive consumption of space content** into **active engagement**.
By combining **VR, physics simulation, and AI guidance**, Dream 2050 shows that:

* Space is **not out of reach**.
* The skills astronauts need are the same skills we need on Earth.
* Every mission connects directly to **planetary care**.

We aim to inspire **global contribution to space exploration by 2050**.
